This is to modify the BMC IPMI LAN interface from the operating system, so we
don't have to reboot into the BIOS interface to modify the configuration.

First, find the LAN interface by iterating through the channels until it prints
something other than an error (here my channel is 1):

<pre class="brush: bash">
# i=0
# until ipmitool lan print $i; do i=$(( i + 1)); done
# echo $i
1
</pre>

Then change the network configuration:

<pre class="brush: bash">
# ipmitool lan set 1 ipsrc   static
# ipmitool lan set 1 ipaddr  192.168.228.76
# ipmitool lan set 1 netmask 255.255.255.0
# ipmitool lan set 1 vlan    1024
</pre>

Test from a remote host with (ADMIN/ADMIN was the factory default):

<pre class="brush: bash">
ipmitool -I lan -H 192.168.228.76 -U ADMIN  -P ADMIN sel list 
</pre>

To change the password, first find the users for this channel

<pre class="brush: bash>
# ipmitool user list 1
ID  Name         Callin  Link Auth  IPMI Msg   Channel Priv Limit
2   ADMIN            false   false      true       ADMINISTRATOR
</pre>

and now use the ID to modify the password:

<pre class="brush: bash>
ipmitool user set password 2 FOO
</pre>

and make sure you test that it worked...
