I wanted to test sending syslog messagest to remote hosts, but the @logger@ utility doesn't support sending syslog messages to remote hosts. To do the test I came up with the following Perl one-liner:

<pre class="brush: bash">
perl -MSys::Syslog=:standard,:extended -e 'setlogsock(udp => shift);
  openlog(qw(test cons user));
  syslog(emerg => "@ARGV")' 1.2.3.4 message to send
</pre>

Older versions of the module (found in RHEL5) don't support supplying the host in @setlogsock()@:

<pre class="brush: bash">
perl -MSys::Syslog=:standard,:extended -e 'setlogsock("udp"); $Sys::Syslog::host = shift;
  openlog(qw(test cons user));
  syslog(emerg => "@ARGV")' 1.2.3.4 message to send
</pre>

If the system had socat installed, I could have used this instead:

<pre class="brush: bash">
socat UNIX-RECVFROM:socket_file udp4-sendto:1.2.3.4:514
logger -d -u socket_file bar
</pre>

Or just use echo and netcat:

<pre class="brush: bash">
echo message to send | nc 1.2.3.4 514
</pre>
